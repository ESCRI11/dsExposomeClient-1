An `ExposomeSet` object is made up from [three different tables](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rexposome/inst/doc/exposome_data_analysis.html#data-format). Having an `ExposomeSet` extremely facilitates exposome data analysis within `dsExposomeClient`. Two minimum pieces of information (e.g. objects) are required:

- exposures: data frame/tibble having the individual ID and the exposure variables;
- phenotypes: data frame/tibble having the individual ID, outcomes and the covariates. 

It is also possible to incorporate annotated information on exposures in a separate object (although it is not mandatory):

- description: data frame/tibble having the exposure names and metadata such as families of exposure

The objects need to be coerced into a R object of class `ExposomeSet` that can be done using `ds.loadExposome()` function as follows.
