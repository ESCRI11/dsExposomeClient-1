To get the names of the families of exposures available on the `ExposomeSet` we can use the function `ds.familyNames()` function. 

```{r}
ds.familyNames("exposome_object")
```

The argument `by.exposure = TRUE` lists the family names and the exposures that contain each family.

```{r}
ds.familyNames("exposome_object", TRUE)
```
