A HCPC (hierarchical classification on principle components) can be performed on the exposures of the exposome dataset. To do so, there's the `ds.exposome_HCPC`. By default, the number of clusters discovered is the one with the higher relative loss of inertia `(i(clusters n+1)/i(cluster n))`, the user can also specify the number of clusters with the argument `nb.clust`. This function has to be passed the server object that holds the results of a PCA.

```{r}
ds.exposome_pca("exposome_object", fam = c("Metals", "Noise"))
hcpc=ds.exposome_HCPC("ds.exposome_pca.Results")[[1]]
```

The object returned by the servers can be plotted using the `FactoMineR::plot.HCPC` function.

```{r}
FactoMineR::plot.HCPC(hcpc)
FactoMineR::plot.HCPC(hcpc, choice = "tree")
FactoMineR::plot.HCPC(hcpc, choice = "bar")
FactoMineR::plot.HCPC(hcpc, choice = "map")
```
